# ML Learn
This project explores the underlying structures of various machine learning models, by implementing each of the following without any specific machine learning library.

---
## Current Models
1. **Linear Regression**

   - **Methods:**
     - `__init__(alpha=0.025, epochs=100)`  
       – Set learning rate and number of gradient‐descent iterations.
     - `fit(X, Y)`  
       – Build design matrix (adds bias), initialize `theta`, and run batch gradient descent.
     - `_lms_gradient_descent()`  
       – Perform one full‐batch update of `theta`.
     - `_hypothesis(X_i)`  
       – Compute prediction for a single (bias‐augmented) sample.
     - `predict(X)`  
       – Return prediction(s) for a bias‐augmented sample or full design matrix.


2. Decision Tree (Working on utility functions for DT)


3. K-Nearest-Neighbor...
