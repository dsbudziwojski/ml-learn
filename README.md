# ML Learn
This project explores the underlying structures of various machine learning models, by implementing each of the following without any specific machine learning library.

---
## Current Models
1. **Linear Regression**  
   - Ordinary least squares via gradient descent and analytical solution.  
   - Methods:  
     - `__init__()` — Initialize parameters (weights, learning rate, epochs).  
     - `fit(X, Y)` — Train on dataset `X` (features) and `Y` (labels).  
     - `predict(X)` — Generate predictions for new inputs.


2. Decision Tree (Working on utility functions for DT)


3. K-Nearest-Neighbor...
